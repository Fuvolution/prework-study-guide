        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The attribute of lang="en" tells the browser the language for the webpage is English!</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element!</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage!</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website!</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage!</li>

          <li>The charset element sets out character encoding!</li>
          <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content!</li>
          <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage!</li>
          <li>The elements inside the body element are child elements of the body element (the body element is the parent element)</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes that element's content and the role that element plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Head, section, and body elements are examples of semantic HTML elements!</li>
          <li>Div and span are NOT semantic HTML elements!</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag!</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets!</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text!</li>
          <li>The heading elements (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) represents the level of heading a given text block represents!</li>
          <li>The ul element represents unordered lists, which are bulleted lists!</li>

          <li> Ex: a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda" surroudned by angle brackets for the opening anchor element!</li>
          <li>The header element appears at the top of the webpage and contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content!</li>
          <li>The biggest heading element h1 should only appear once on each webpage!</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the webpage and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation!</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content (topic titles, etc.)!</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS apply to a specific HTML tag using a style attribute with a CSS rule directly in the HTML file!</li>
            <li>Internal CSS style sheet apply CSS rules only to the specific web page where the style element is placed inside the head element for that webpage!</li>
            <li>External CSS style sheet is a CSS file that contains CSS rules that only applies to HTML files that contain the link element placed in the HTML's head element!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Basics of CSS Rule:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules (or declarations) will apply!</li>
            <li>Declarations are made of the CSS property and the value of that corresponding property! Ex: {color: blue} is a declaration where color is Property and blue is the Value!</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element and is not visible on the page!</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element!</li>
            <li>CSS Box model from Innermost to Outermost: Content, Padding, Border, and Margin</li>
          </ul>
          <li>* selector apply the CSS declarations to all the elements on the page!</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, which allows the declaration to affect both selectors!</li>
          <li>The img selector assign property values to any image element in the markup!</li>
          <li>The display property is assigned with the block vlaue, which assigns each image to start on a new line!</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using either the elements or class attributes as selectors!</li>
          <li>Using class attributes as selectors enable us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule!</li>
          <li>Class selectors are desginated with a period (.) followed by the class attribute like .card!</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame; it's described by the X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color!</li>
          <li>CSS Properties and Values list: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS"></a></li>
          <li>We need to link our external CSS stylesheet file to our HTML file to have the properties applied to elements and classes specified in HTML file!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To link our HTML and external CSS file together, we use link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" surrounded by angle brackets!</li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource!</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource!</li>
            <li>The href attribute uses a relative path, which means the location is derived from the current location: the index.html file!</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Resources for JavaScript info:</li>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics"> JavaScript Basics</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">JavaScript data types</a></li>
          </ul>
          <li>The .js file extension indicates that file is a JavaScript file!</li>
          <li>We use the var keyword to declare a variable, then give that variable a name and then a corresponding value!</li>
          <li>Example of creating a variable: var shape = "circle";</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon!</li>
          <li>The console.log method can output a message to the web console by adding an argument! Ex: console.log(topics);</li>
          <li>We need to link the JavaScript file to our HTML file! Ex in footer element of HTML file: script src="./assets/script.js" surroudned by angle brackets!</li>
          <li>We placed the link in the footer element within the body element in HTML file!</li>
          <li>We need to use Chrome DevTools to see the effects of our JavaScript code, which can be accessed through right-clicking on a Google Chrome webpage and selecting Inspect (or Control + Shift + I)! We then move to Console!</li>
          <li>JavaScript's control flow is code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page!</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted and controlled by conditional statements and loops!</li>
          <li>To create an if statement, we will use this format:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              if (condition) { 
                //block of code to be executed if condition is truthy 
              }
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Format of if else if statements: </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              if (condition) { 
                //block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy 
              } else if (second condition) {
                //block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy
              }
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal and of the same data type!</li>
          <li>An array is a single varaible that is used to hold a group of data and can store different type of data simulataneously!</li>
          <li>Declaring an array example 1: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>Declaring an array example 2: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];</li>
          <li>The index is the location of the data item in the array!</li>
          <li>JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed and sequential: the first item in any array has an index of 0</li>
          <li>To access a data inside an array: array-name[index];</li>
          <li>A for loop contains 3 important statements:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop!</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition!</li>
            <li>The third statement is the increment or decreement that allows the array to iterate over each item!</li>
            <li>for loop format: for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { // code block }</li>
            <li>x++ is shorthanded for x+1</li>
          </ul>
          <li> Comment out multiple lines of code with /* and */ pair!</li>
