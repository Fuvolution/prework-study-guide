        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain the property assignments specified from the specificied class selector!</li>
          <li>We need to link our external CSS stylesheet file to our HTML file to have the properties applied to elements and classes specified in HTML file!</li>
          <li>To link our HTML and external CSS file together, we use link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" surrounded by angle brackets!</li>
          <li> The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource!</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource!</li>
          <li>The href attribute uses a relative path, which means the location is derived from the current location: the index.html file!</li>
